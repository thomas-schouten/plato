PlateTorques

`PlateTorques` is a class that contains the data and methods to calculate the torques acting on the tectonic plates in global plate reconstructions.
This class uses several other classes to calculate the torques, such as the `Plates`, `Slabs`, and `Mantle` classes.

The `Plates` class is used to store the data and geometries for the tectonic plates in the reconstruction.

The `Points` class is used to store the data on the points of the reconstruction and to calculate the GPE and mantle drag torques.

The `Slabs` class is used to store the data on the subduction zones of the reconstruction and to calculate the slab pull and slab bend torques.
